Trying to figure out serverless has been fruitless in the last few weeks. I've
asked Mr. Navkal and fellow Energize Andover members about my issue, but we
haven't found any success.

Today, I researched some alternatives for deploying code. [Zappa] is a Python
specific tool for building and deploying event-drive software on AWS Lambda.
However, it's less popular than serverless. [Flask-Ask] is a framework that
makes it easier to develop Skills with Python. I found [this guide] for getting
started with it. Also, I found [this guide][1] for using it in conjunction with
Zappa.

I decided on using the Flask-Ask + Zappa guide for this project. It should
spare me some headache, hopefully.
