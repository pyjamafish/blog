Trying to figure out serverless has been fruitless in the last few weeks. I've asked Mr. Navkal and fellow Energize 
Andover members about my issue, but we haven't found any success.

Today, I researched some alternatives for deploying code. [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa) is a python 
specific tool for building and deploying event-drive software on AWS Lambda. However, it's less popular than 
serverless. 
[Flask-Ask](https://flask-ask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a framework that makes it easier to develop 
Skills with Python. I found 
[this guide](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/Tx14R0IYYGH3SKT/Flask-Ask-A-New-Python-Framework-for-Rapid-Alexa-Skills-Kit-Development) 
for getting started with it. Also, I found 
[this guide](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/8e8ad73a-99e9-4c0f-a7b3-60f92287b0bf/new-alexa-tutorial-deploy-flask-ask-skills-to-aws-lambda-with-zappa) 
for using it in conjunction with Zappa.
