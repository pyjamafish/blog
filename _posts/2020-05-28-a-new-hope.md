Trying to figure out serverless has been fruitless in the last few weeks. I've 
asked Mr. Navkal and fellow Energize Andover members about my issue, but we 
haven't found any success.

Today, I researched some alternatives for deploying code. 
[Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa) is a Python specific tool for 
building and deploying event-drive software on AWS Lambda. However, it's less 
popular than serverless. 
[Flask-Ask](https://flask-ask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a 
framework that makes it easier to develop Skills with Python. I found 
[this guide](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/Tx14R0IYYGH3SKT/Flask-Ask-A-New-Python-Framework-for-Rapid-Alexa-Skills-Kit-Development) 
for getting started with it. Also, I found 
[this guide](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/8e8ad73a-99e9-4c0f-a7b3-60f92287b0bf/new-alexa-tutorial-deploy-flask-ask-skills-to-aws-lambda-with-zappa) 
for using it in conjunction with Zappa.

I decided on using the Flask-Ask + Zappa guide for this project. It should 
spare me some headache, hopefully.
