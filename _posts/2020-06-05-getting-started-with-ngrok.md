I started working with ngrok in the last two days to set up my Alexa Skill 
testing. I installed ngrok using Chocolatey and watched a 
[Flask-ask + ngrok start guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC2zi4WIFX0). 
I followed the guide to connect a basic Python script to Alexa.

However, I received the error `There was a problem with the requested skill's 
response` again. ngrok displayed `POST / 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR`. I'm too 
tired to work this out tonight; I'll take a look tomorrow.
