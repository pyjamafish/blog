With everything working on GalliumOS, development proceeded with full steam. In
the past weeks, I set up the temperature functions for individual rooms and
wing averages. I also successfully tested my code by running it with Ngrok.

In the next week, I hope to migrate my code from Python 2 to Python 3.
