Setting up a new project has never felt this good. Creating my repository 
for Python 3.6 and installing my dependencies went off without a hitch on
Linux, to my great relief.

The only thing I needed to change was the import statement format. Reading

helped me understand the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 imports.
