Today, I was introduced to a project called Etiologic Classification for
Ischemic Stroke (ECIS) through Electronic Health Record-based Natural Language
Processing. Lead by Dr. Feifan Liu, a professor at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School, this project aims to develop software that
automatically classifies the causes of ischemic stroke (IS).

Here is some background information that I learned:

-   Stroke is a major issue in today's world, as it is the 5th leading cause of
    death in the US and 2nd leading cause of death globally.
-   The majority of the burden of stroke is attributed to IS.
-   Etiologic subtype classification (identifying the causes) of IS is critical
    for treatment management and outcome prediction.
-   However, classification is currently performed through manual chart review,
    a time-consuming, error-prone process.
-   By developing a deep learning-based NLP system for automatic
    classification, the project hopes to overcome these limitations.

I was assigned to work on the pre-processing software; my program would use
Pandas to manipulate the Electronic Health Record (EHR) data into a NLP
system-usable format. I'm eager to contribute to a project that can potentially
help improve the treatment of stroke victims, and I'm grateful for the chance
to improve my work with Energize Andover using the new Pandas knowledge that I
learn.
