## About the author
Hey, I'm Fisher!
I'm a CS student at Washington University in St. Louis.

## About this blog
In this blog,
I plan to document projects I work on, issues I encounter, and things I learn.

## Colophon
At the moment, this website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
I have a love-hate relationship with Jekyll; maybe I'll move to a different SSG one of these days.

The theme is my own unreleased theme, which I've named Linnaeus.
It's a fork of [Lagrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) by Paul Le.

You can find the source code for this website in its GitHub repo, [seasonedfish/blog](https://github.com/seasonedfish/blog).
